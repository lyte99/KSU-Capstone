TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
â€œOCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,â€ said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. â€œThis case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.â€
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entitiesâ€™ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCRâ€™s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiariesâ€™ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiariesâ€™ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
â€œTriple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiariesâ€™ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,â€ said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  â€œWe are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCRâ€™s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.â€

The CE initially reported that the breached ePHI included names, addresses, zip codes, dates of births, social security numbers, diagnostic conditions and other treatment information.

Thus, the CE determined that the theft did not constitute a breach of ePHI.  Further, the CE determined that the laptop was an information technology department laptop that only contained financial data and upper management e-mails.  As of the result of OCRâ€™s investigation, OCR has required the CE to conduct a risk analysis, implement a risk management plan, revise its policies and procedures, and re-train its staff.

MAPFRE Life Insurance Company of Puerto Rico (MAPFRE) has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $2.2 million and implementing a corrective action plan. With this resolution amount, OCR balanced potential violations of the HIPAA Rules with evidence provided by MAPFRE with regard to its present financial standing.  MAPFRE is a subsidiary company of MAPFRE S.A., a global multinational insurance company headquartered in Spain. MAPFRE underwrites and administers a variety of insurance products and services in Puerto Rico, including personal and group health insurance plans.
On September 29, 2011, MAPFRE filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a USB data storage device (described as a â€œpen driveâ€) containing ePHI was stolen from its IT department, where the device was left without safeguards overnight.   According to the report, the USB data storage device included complete names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.   The report noted that the breach affected 2,209 individuals.   MAPFRE informed OCR that it was able to identify the breached ePHI by reconstituting the data on the computer on which the USB data storage device was attached. OCRâ€™s investigation revealed MAPFREâ€™s noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules, specifically a failure to conduct its risk analysis and implement risk management plans, contrary to its prior representations, and a failure to deploy encryption or an equivalent alternative measure on its laptops and removable storage media until September 1, 2014.  MAPFRE also failed to implement or delayed implementing other corrective measures it informed OCR it would undertake.
â€œCovered entities must not only make assessments to safeguard ePHI, they must act on those assessments as wellâ€ said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. â€œOCR works tirelessly and collaboratively with covered entities to set clear expectations and consequences.â€

1/24/2014,"Triple-S Salud, Inc. - Breach Case#2",,PHYS,MED,398000,"Triple-S Management Corporation (â€œTRIPLE-Sâ€), on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Triple-S Salud Inc., Triple-C Inc. and Triple-S Advantage Inc. , formerly known as American Health Medicare Inc., has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
â€œOCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,â€ said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. â€œThis case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.â€
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entitiesâ€™ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCRâ€™s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiariesâ€™ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiariesâ€™ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
â€œTriple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiariesâ€™ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,â€ said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  â€œWe are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCRâ€™s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.â€
